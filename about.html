    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm <span class="highlight">Sankalp Mishra</span>, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from <span class="highlight">Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University</span>, Ayodhya. My academic focus is in software development, and I am passionate about building modern, responsive websites and user interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      My core technical skills include <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span>, and I’ve built small projects like a <span class="highlight">Clock Web App</span> and a <span class="highlight">Spotify UI Clone</span> to strengthen my frontend knowledge. I'm also learning core Java and exploring backend development to become a full-stack web developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and constantly try to improve my logical thinking and debugging skills. I keep myself updated with current tech trends and love to experiment with new tools and frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m looking for opportunities in the IT/software industry where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer. In the future, I plan to pursue an <span class="highlight">MCA</span> to deepen my technical knowledge and open doors to better opportunities in the engineering field.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m open to internships, entry-level developer roles, and collaborative tech projects. Let’s connect and build something great!
